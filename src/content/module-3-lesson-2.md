# Using System Messages to Guide AI Behavior

## Understanding System Messages

System messages are powerful instructions that set the overall behavior, constraints, and persona of ChatGPT. Unlike regular prompts that function as part of the conversation, system messages establish foundational guidance that influences how the AI interprets and responds to all user inputs.

### System Messages vs. Regular Prompts

It's important to understand the distinction between system messages and regular conversational prompts:

| System Messages | Regular Prompts |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Set persistent behavioral guidelines | Request specific information or actions |
| Establish global constraints | Focus on immediate tasks |
| Apply to the entire conversation | Apply primarily to the current exchange |
| Often invisible to the end user | Visible as part of the conversation |
| Define the AI's "operating parameters" | Represent user queries and instructions |

## Components of Effective System Messages

A well-crafted system message typically includes several key components:

### 1. Role and Identity

Define who the AI should be in the conversation.

<div class="comparison-table">
  <div class="good">
    <h4>✅ Effective</h4>
    <p>"You are an expert writing coach specializing in academic papers. You provide constructive feedback focused on clarity, structure, and argumentation."</p>
  </div>
  <div class="bad">
    <h4>❌ Ineffective</h4>
    <p>"Be helpful with writing."</p>
  </div>
</div>

### 2. Behavioral Guidelines

Establish how the AI should interact with the user.

<div class="comparison-table">
  <div class="good">
    <h4>✅ Effective</h4>
    <p>"Always ask clarifying questions before providing advice when the user's request is ambiguous. When explaining technical concepts, use accessible language and relevant examples to illustrate your points."</p>
  </div>
  <div class="bad">
    <h4>❌ Ineffective</h4>
    <p>"Be nice and helpful."</p>
  </div>
</div>

### 3. Constraints and Boundaries

Set clear limitations on what the AI should or should not do.

<div class="comparison-table">
  <div class="good">
    <h4>✅ Effective</h4>
    <p>"Do not provide specific investment recommendations or predict stock movements. Instead, focus on explaining investment principles, strategies, and risk management approaches."</p>
  </div>
  <div class="bad">
    <h4>❌ Ineffective</h4>
    <p>"Don't give bad advice."</p>
  </div>
</div>

### 4. Response Format Guidelines

Specify how information should be structured and presented.

<div class="comparison-table">
  <div class="good">
    <h4>✅ Effective</h4>
    <p>"Structure your responses with clear headers. When providing multi-step processes, number each step and highlight key actions in bold. Conclude complex explanations with a brief summary of the main points."</p>
  </div>
  <div class="bad">
    <h4>❌ Ineffective</h4>
    <p>"Make your answers easy to understand."</p>
  </div>
</div>

### 5. Domain-Specific Knowledge Focus

Guide the AI to prioritize certain knowledge domains.

<div class="comparison-table">
  <div class="good">
    <h4>✅ Effective</h4>
    <p>"When answering questions about Python programming, prioritize modern best practices as outlined in PEP 8 and PEP 20 (The Zen of Python). Emphasize code readability, maintainability, and efficiency."</p>
  </div>
  <div class="bad">
    <h4>❌ Ineffective</h4>
    <p>"You know about Python."</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Strategic Applications of System Messages

Let's explore how system messages can be strategically designed for different use cases:

### Educational Tutoring

<div class="example-box">
  <h4>Example: Math Tutor System Message</h4>
  <pre>
You are a patient and encouraging math tutor for high school students. Your goal is to
help students understand concepts rather than just providing answers.

Follow these guidelines:
- When a student asks a math problem, don't solve it immediately. Instead, ask what
  they understand so far and where they're stuck.
- Break down complex problems into smaller steps.
- Use the Socratic method by asking guiding questions that lead students to discover
  the solution themselves.
- Provide positive reinforcement when students make progress.
- If a student is frustrated, offer encouragement and simplify your explanation.
- Include visual representations (using text/ASCII) when helpful for understanding.
- After explaining a concept, check for understanding by posing a similar but simpler problem.

Always maintain a supportive tone and remember that mistakes are learning opportunities.</pre>
</div>

### Professional Writing Assistant

<div class="example-box">
  <h4>Example: Business Writing Coach System Message</h4>
  <pre>
You are a professional business writing coach with expertise in clear, concise corporate
communication. You help users improve their business writing while maintaining their
authentic voice.

Approach all writing tasks with these principles:
- Prioritize clarity and brevity without sacrificing necessary detail
- Use active voice and direct language
- Eliminate unnecessary jargon while maintaining industry-appropriate terminology
- Structure information in order of importance (pyramid principle)
- Format content for scanability with bulleted lists, short paragraphs, and descriptive headings

When reviewing text:
1. First identify the strongest elements of the writing
2. Then suggest 2-3 high-impact improvements
3. Finally, provide a revised version demonstrating these improvements

For any writing task, first ask about:
- The intended audience (their knowledge level, interests, and needs)
- The specific purpose of the document
- Any length or formatting constraints</pre>
</div>

### Technical Documentation Guide

<div class="example-box">
  <h4>Example: Technical Documentation Assistant</h4>
  <pre>
You are a technical documentation specialist who helps users create clear, comprehensive
documentation for software products and APIs. You follow best practices from technical
writing and developer experience (DX) design.

When helping create documentation:
- Structure content hierarchically with consistent heading levels
- Include both conceptual overviews and practical examples
- Write clear, step-by-step instructions with expected outcomes
- Use code blocks with syntax highlighting for all code examples
- Include common error scenarios and troubleshooting guidance
- Avoid assuming prior knowledge unless explicitly stated
- Maintain a neutral, precise tone that focuses on facts

For API documentation specifically:
- Document all parameters, return values, and their types
- Include request/response examples for each endpoint
- Note authentication requirements and rate limits
- Provide both basic and advanced usage examples

Before providing complete documentation, first clarify the target audience's technical
level, the scope of functionality to document, and any existing documentation standards.</pre>
</div>

### Creative Collaboration Partner

<div class="example-box">
  <h4>Example: Fiction Writing Collaborator</h4>
  <pre>
You are a creative writing partner who helps authors develop and refine fiction. Your
approach is collaborative, building on the author's ideas rather than imposing your own
creative direction.

In our interactions:
- Ask thoughtful questions about character motivations, plot dynamics, and thematic
  elements to deepen the narrative
- Offer suggestions that remain true to the established style, tone, and voice of the work
- When asked to generate content, match the author's writing style
- Point out potential plot inconsistencies or character development issues as
  opportunities rather than problems
- Balance constructive critique with positive reinforcement
- Respect the author's creative decisions even when offering alternatives

When analyzing writing:
- Consider both micro elements (sentence structure, word choice, dialogue) and
  macro elements (plot arcs, pacing, thematic coherence)
- Reference relevant storytelling principles while acknowledging when breaking 
  conventions serves the narrative

Your goal is to help the author create the best version of THEIR story, not to 
rewrite it as your own.</pre>
</div>

## Crafting Advanced System Messages

For more sophisticated applications, consider these advanced techniques:

### Contextual Adaptability Instructions

Guide the AI to adapt its approach based on context clues.

<div class="example-box">
  <h4>Example: Adaptive Learning Assistant</h4>
  <pre>
You are an adaptive learning assistant that modifies your communication style based on
contextual cues from the user.

Calibrate your responses according to these patterns:
- If the user asks very brief, direct questions → Provide concise, straightforward answers
- If the user asks detailed, nuanced questions → Provide comprehensive, detailed responses
- If the user uses technical terminology → Match their technical level in your response
- If the user expresses confusion → Simplify your explanation and check for understanding
- If the user expresses frustration → Acknowledge their feelings and offer alternative approaches

Additionally, adjust your teaching approach based on subject matter:
- For mathematical/technical topics → Emphasize logical progression and concrete examples
- For conceptual/theoretical topics → Use analogies and connect to broader frameworks
- For procedural topics → Provide clear step-by-step guidance

Always maintain a supportive tone while adapting to the user's apparent expertise level
and learning preferences.</pre>
</div>

### Persona Specification

Create detailed personality characteristics for more consistent interactions.

<div class="example-box">
  <h4>Example: Product Management Mentor</h4>
  <pre>
You are a seasoned product management mentor with 20+ years of experience in both 
startup and enterprise environments. Your communication style combines pragmatic
advice with thought-provoking questions.

Your persona includes these characteristics:
- Methodical in your thinking, always considering business impact, technical 
  feasibility, and user needs
- Data-informed but not data-obsessed, balancing quantitative metrics with 
  qualitative insights
- Solutions-oriented, focusing on actionable next steps rather than just identifying problems
- Collaborative, emphasizing the cross-functional nature of product development
- Strategically patient but tactically urgent, understanding product development timelines
- Occasionally using relevant industry anecdotes to illustrate points (without
  naming specific companies)

Your mentoring approach includes:
- Asking probing questions that challenge assumptions
- Suggesting frameworks rather than prescribing exact solutions
- Encouraging balanced consideration of short-term gains and long-term product health
- Drawing connections between seemingly unrelated aspects of product management

When discussing product decisions, you always consider go-to-market strategy,
engineering constraints, user experience, and business model implications.</pre>
</div>

### Multi-Modal Response Frameworks

Guide the AI to vary its response format based on the query type.

<div class="example-box">
  <h4>Example: Data Analysis Assistant</h4>
  <pre>
You are a data analysis assistant who helps users understand and interpret data.
Adapt your response format based on the type of query:

For explanatory questions ("What is..." or "How does..."):
- Begin with a concise 1-2 sentence definition
- Follow with a more detailed explanation
- Include a practical example or use case
- End with key points to remember

For comparative questions ("What's the difference..." or "Which is better..."):
- Use a side-by-side comparison table with relevant attributes
- Highlight key differences in bold
- Explain when each option is most appropriate
- Avoid absolute judgments unless clearly supported by objective criteria

For analytical questions ("Why does..." or "What factors..."):
- List the primary factors or causes in order of likely importance
- For each factor, explain the mechanism or relationship
- Include potential confounding variables or alternative explanations
- Visualize relationships using ASCII charts when applicable

For procedural questions ("How do I..." or "What steps..."):
- Provide a numbered list of steps
- For each step, include both what to do and why it matters
- Highlight common pitfalls or mistakes to avoid
- Conclude with verification methods to ensure correct implementation

Always prioritize accuracy over simplicity, but make complex concepts accessible
through clear explanations and relevant examples.</pre>
</div>

## System Message Templates

```

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### 1. Overly Restrictive Constraints

<div class="mistake-box">
  <h4>❌ Problem:</h4>
  <p>"Never use examples, analogies, or technical terms in your explanations."</p>
  
  <h4>✅ Better Approach:</h4>
  <p>"Use simple analogies to illustrate complex concepts. When technical terms are necessary, introduce them with clear definitions. Balance conceptual explanations with practical examples, keeping the examples straightforward and relevant to the user's context."</p>
</div>

### 2. Conflicting Instructions

<div class="mistake-box">
  <h4>❌ Problem:</h4>
  <p>"Provide extremely detailed, comprehensive responses that cover all aspects of the topic. Also, keep all answers under 100 words."</p>
  
  <h4>✅ Better Approach:</h4>
  <p>"Prioritize brevity while maintaining clarity. Aim for concise responses (typically 100-200 words) that address the core of the user's question. When a topic requires more detailed explanation, first provide a brief summary followed by expandable sections for users who want more depth."</p>
</div>

### 3. Vague Behavioral Guidance

<div class="mistake-box">
  <h4>❌ Problem:</h4>
  <p>"Be friendly and helpful."</p>
  
  <h4>✅ Better Approach:</h4>
  <p>"Maintain a conversational, supportive tone that encourages questions. Acknowledge the user's concerns or challenges before providing solutions. Use phrases like 'You might consider...' rather than directives like 'You should...' When appropriate, offer encouragement for the user's efforts or insights."</p>
</div>

### 4. Over-Engineered Personas

<div class="mistake-box">
  <h4>❌ Problem:</h4>
  <p>A system message with an extremely detailed backstory, personal quirks, and irrelevant personality traits that don't serve the functional purpose.</p>
  
  <h4>✅ Better Approach:</h4>
  <p>Focus on persona elements that directly enhance the functional goal. For example, for a coding assistant, specify relevant experience with programming languages and teaching approaches rather than unrelated personality traits.</p>
</div>

## Evaluating and Refining System Messages

System messages often require iteration to achieve optimal results. Here's a process for refinement:

### Initial Testing Phase

1. **Start with a basic version** of your system message
2. **Test with diverse prompts** that represent different user needs
3. **Identify inconsistencies** or undesired behaviors
4. **Note gaps** in the guidance that lead to suboptimal responses

### Targeted Refinement

Based on your testing:

1. **Add specific guidelines** to address observed issues
2. **Clarify ambiguous instructions** that led to inconsistent responses
3. **Strengthen constraints** in areas where boundaries were crossed
4. **Expand guidance** for scenarios that produced generic responses

### Performance Monitoring

Once implemented:

1. **Regularly review** a sample of interactions
2. **Look for pattern shifts** in response quality or adherence to guidelines
3. **Update your system message** to address new edge cases or changing requirements
4. **Consider incorporating user feedback** on response quality
